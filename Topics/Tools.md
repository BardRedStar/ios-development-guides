## Git
Git-flow with naming conventions and commit style.

[Take a look how we work with git](Tools/work-with-git.md)

## Cocoapods
1. Pods directory should be added to <code>.gitignore</code> file.
2. Files <code>Podfile</code> and <code>Podfile.lock</code> should be added to Git index.

## SwiftLint
Use [SwiftLint tool](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint). Take a look at our latest [.swiftlint.yml](../Development/.swiftlint.yml) as a basic template for a project.

Also Check out [Swift guidelines](CodeStyle.md#swift)
